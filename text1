The embattled regime in Yemen has boosted its cooperation with U.S. intelligence and counter-terrorism efforts in recent months as it tries to push back Al Qaeda militants and other insurgents who have captured towns and other territory in the impoverished nation, according to U.S. Defense officials.

The U.S. officials said Al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, may have "overreached" by deploying its fighters to overwhelm local security forces in the southern province of Abyan. Better-equipped Yemeni troops have mounted operations in the area and killed a number of militants.
